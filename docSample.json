Fomos super bem recebidos com uma grande simpatia e predisposição a ajudar com qualquer coisa que fosse necessário.\r\nA casa era ainda melhor do que parecia nas fotos, totalmente equipada, com mantas, aquecedor e tudo o que pudessemos precisar.\r\nA localização não podia ser melhor! Não há melhor do que acordar de manhã e ao virar da esquina estar a ribeira do Porto."
